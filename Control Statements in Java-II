                                                                                      Looping (Iteration) Statements

Used to execute a block of code repeatedly.

1 for Loop
↬ Used when the number of iterations is known.
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}

2 while Loop
↬ Checks condition before execution.
int i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
}

3 do-while Loop
↬ Executes the loop at least once.
int i = 1;
do {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
} while (i <= 5);

❖ Comparative Table
| Loop Type  | Condition Check | Best Used When   | Advantages           | Limitations        |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| `for`      | Before          | Iterations known | Compact, readable    | Not flexible       |
| `while`    | Before          | Condition-based  | Flexible             | Infinite loop risk |
| `do-while` | After           | At least one run | Guaranteed execution | Less control       |

▪️ Performance & Best Practices
► Prefer for loop for arrays and fixed counts
► Use while loop for unknown iteration logic
► Use do-while only when one execution is mandatory
► Always update loop variables to avoid infinite loops
► Use break and continue carefully for clarity

⋄ for and while are entry-controlled loops
⋄ do-while is an exit-controlled loop
⋄ do-while executes at least once
