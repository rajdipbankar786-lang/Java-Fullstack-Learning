                                                                                                   Java software’s:
There are two types of java software which we have to deploy to work with java.
These are given below:
1.	JDK(Java Development Kit)
2.	JRE(Java Runtime Environment)
3.  JVM(Executes bytecode)

○ Java Software Components
Relationship Between JVM, JRE, and JDK
JDK
 └── JRE
      └── JVM

To develop and run Java applications, we need three main Java software components.

1. JDK (Java Development Kit)
• JDK is a complete software development kit used to develop, compile, and run Java programs.
⦾ It contains:
 • JRE
➢ Development tools like:
 •  javac (compiler)
 •  java (launcher)
 •  javadoc
 •  jar
 •  Debugging tools
   Used by: Java developers.

2. JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
• JRE provides the environment to run Java applications.
⦾ It contains:
• JVM
• Core Java class libraries
• JRE is required only to run Java programs, not to develop them.
   Used by: End users who want to run Java applications.

3. JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
• JVM is an abstract machine that provides a runtime environment to execute Java bytecode.
• It converts bytecode into machine-specific instructions.
• JVM makes Java platform-independent.
• JVM is part of JRE, not installed separately.

⦾ Main functions of JVM:
➢ Loads bytecode
➢ Verifies code
➢ Executes code
➢ Manages memory (Heap, Stack, Garbage Collection

➦ One-Line Examples
➧JDK: Used to create Java applications.
➧JRE: Used to run Java applications.
➧JVM: Executes Java bytecode.
