                                                                                           Control Statements in Java

Control statements determine the flow of execution of a Java program. They decide which statements execute, how many times they execute, or when execution jumps to another part of the program.
 Java control statements are broadly classified into three categories:
⓵ Selection (Decision-Making) Statements:-
➊ if Statement
↪︎ Executes a block of code when the condition is true.
Example:-
if (age >= 18) {
    System.out.println("Eligible for voting");
}
☢︎ Features
▪︎ Works with boolean expressions
▪︎ Supports relational (> < == !=) and logical operators (&& || !)
▪︎ Simple and lightweight
▪︎ Can be nested

➋ if-else Statement
↪︎ Provides an alternative block if the condition is false.
Example:-
if (marks >= 40) {
    System.out.println("Pass");
} else {
    System.out.println("Fail");
}
☢︎ Features
▪︎ Ensures exactly one block executes
▪︎ Supports all comparison operators
▪︎ Prevents ambiguous execution

➌ else-if Ladder
↪︎ Used to check multiple conditions sequentially.
Example:-
if (marks >= 75) {
    System.out.println("Distinction");
} else if (marks >= 60) {
    System.out.println("First Class");
} else if (marks >= 40) {
    System.out.println("Pass");
} else {
    System.out.println("Fail");
}
☢︎ Features
▪︎ Conditions are evaluated top to bottom
▪︎ First true condition executes
▪︎ Remaining conditions are skipped
▪︎ Optional final else

➍ switch Statement
↪︎ Selects execution based on a fixed value.
Supported types: byte, short, int, char, String, enum
Example:-
int day = 2;

switch (day) {
    case 1:
        System.out.println("Monday");
        break;
    case 2:
        System.out.println("Tuesday");
        break;
    default:
        System.out.println("Invalid day");
}
☢︎ Features
▪︎ Works with int, char, String, enum
▪︎ Cleaner than long else-if ladders
▪︎ Supports default case
▪︎ Faster execution (internally optimized)

✖︎ Comparative Summary Table
| Statement | Best For         | Advantages     | Limitations         |
| --------- | ---------------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| `if`      | Single condition | Simple, fast   | No alternative path |
| `if-else` | Two outcomes     | Clear decision | Limited choices     |
| `else-if` | Multiple ranges  | Logical flow   | Hard to maintain    |
| `switch`  | Fixed values     | Clean, fast    | No range checking   |
